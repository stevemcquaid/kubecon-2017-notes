7 - Hybrid-cloud, HIPPA compliant enterprise with kubernetes

steve sloka

HIPPA RULES
encryption at REST
encryption in TRANSIT
Auditing to the user
BAA (Business Associate Agreement)

On-prem
k8s infra
    red hat atomic
    coreos techtonic
storage
    nfs
    local storage

lb
    f5 - nodeport

workloads
    ci/ci (gitlab runners + jenkins)
    local "Agents"
        data collection
        data proxies

cloud infra
    aws
    single region multi-az
    multiple worker auto-scaling groups (ASG)
    cloud formation + core os
    ecr docker reg
    classic elb
    vpn to on prem

github.com/upmc-enterprises/kubernetes-on-aws

OpsWorks to manage ssh keys

not everything is compliant
new services
internate gateway -> ELB (VPN)

IGW -> ELB (not encrypted)

AWS to the rescue

k8s workloads
stateless applications
easy?
    self-contained
    no storage
    deps are outside of scope
    easily scheduled/scales
    implementd via k8s deployments
    just need encryption in trasnit and youre good

stateful application struggles
    how manage persistent storage?
    resize/upgrade?
    reconfigure - templating

statefulsets
    allow for persistent sotrage replicas to have an identiy
    one persistant volume per claim

how manage persistent storage?
    as long as you stay in the same AZ volume will follow you around?

An operator is an application-specific controller that extends the k8s api to create configure and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a kubernetes user

make it work like a cloud provided offering


elastic-operator
    https://github.com/upmc-enterprises/elasticsearch-operator
    full tls
    automatic cert generation
    encrypted EBS volumes
    communication TLS (SearchGuard*)
    span az in AWS (creation and scaling)
    snapshots to s3
    deploy add-ons automatically
    kibana/cerebro

there is some work to do
    shard / zone allocation
    elastic cluster status
    rolling restarts
    upgrades

kong-operator
    github.com/upmc-enterprises/kong-operator
    open source api gateway
    isolate traffic into our applications
    handles authentication (HMAC) for clients

configuration for aplications stored as files (TPRs)
    checked into source
    code reviewd
    http is not easily reproducible

network policies
    limit access to api
    (network policies)
