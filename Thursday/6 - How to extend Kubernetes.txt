"Kubernetes is a large project" - 
well established processes
    Reviews
    Feature proposals
    Community meetings
    ...
    Stability!
How do I get my new feature in?
    even when its obviously so cool as persistent volume snapshots


Simple idea: lets take snapshot of a PersistentVolume in k8s
    present the idea to the community
    create proposal and have it reviewed
    write the code and have it reviewed
    have the code merged

... nope 
    use plan b


Custom Resources
Custom resources
    basic building block for easy kubernetes extentions
    api objects(implementing the runtime.object interface)
    dynamically added/registered
experiment outside of kubernetes
    kubernetes-incubator on github

custom external controller
    obj itself cant do much
    controller talked to api server and makes use of the new objects (watches for updates)
    takes care about registering the CRD

Disadvantages
    might need more api calls - perf penalities
    more work fo rthe users/admins (deployments RBAC...)
    dependencies might be more complicated to manage
    less visible for potential users and contributors
