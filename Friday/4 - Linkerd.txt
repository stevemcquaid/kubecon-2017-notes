HTTP routing with Linkerd

ncbi.nlb. ... .gov


http_proxy=linkerd:4140 curl http://foo.l5d.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

http_proxy = works w/ containers & w/o
linkerd = /etc/hosts
foo = service
l5d.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov = convention

curl -H "Host: foo.http://foo.l5d.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" http://linkerd:4140

location: /foo
Request header set Host goo.l5d...
Proxy pass http://linkerd

routers:
    - protocol: http
        dstPrefix: /http
        identifier:
            - kind. io.l5g.header.token
            header: Host
            interpreter:
                ...
servers:
    - port: 4140


location table:
    /http => /#/rinet/80
    /http -> /$/domainToPath

    /gov/nih/nlm/ncbi/l5d => /service

    /service => /#consul/.local

last 6 mo of linkerd
    focused on grpc specifically
    not a lot of features to likerd
    helping people to production
    moving forward to become hardened prod system
    swiss army knife of container networking
    linkerd tcp - small rust proxy - L4 routing

jvm
runs anywhere

porblems that linkerd solves:
security
viz
routing control
    
dtabs?
generating dtabs with rubia?

load tests are bad until caches warm up

perf contraints of jvm are a brick wall in front of things

linkerdtcp - L4 proxy
    - RUST
    - TLS traffic
    - namerd for svc discovery

conduit:
narrow surface area unlike linkerd

-----------
web & cli
-
public api
-
**CONDUIT**
-
proxy api
-----------

CONDUIT svcs
telemetry svc (prometheus install coupled with conduit)
destination svc (talks to k8s api - does svc/endpoint lookups)

want to have routing svcs and other things as well
