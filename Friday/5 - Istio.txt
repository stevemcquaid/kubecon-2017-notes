Reliable application roll out and operations with Istio
Lin Sun - IBM - @linsun_unc
Mander Jog, google @mandarjog

Common Devops challenge 1
how do i roll out newer version of ms without downtime
how do i ensure traffic continue to go to current version before the newer version is tested and ready

Challenge 2
How do i do A/B testing?
release new version to a subset of users in a precise way
I have launched B in the dark, but how can i keep B to myself or a small testing group?

Challenge 3
how do i do canary testing
how do i test the new version to a subset of users
how do  i proceed to full rollout after satisfactorying testing period

Other common devops challenges
things dont always go correctly in production.. how do i inject fault to my ms to prepare myself?
our teams write svc in diff languages
nmy serices can only handle certain rate, how can i limit rate
i need to view what is going on with each of services when crisis arises

launched by IBM Google Lyft in may 2017

intel routing and lb
controll traffic between svc with dynamic route config

resilience across languages and platform
shielding app from flaky networks and cscading failures in adverse conditions

secure acess with fleet wide policy enforcement
appluy org policy to svc

in depth telemetry and reporting
understand deps between vsc, the nature and flow of traffic between them and id issues

components of istio
envoy
pilot
istio-security (formerly istio-paas?)
mixer

our sidecar of choice:
envoy
c++ L4/L7 proxy


rate limiting
traffic partitioning

telemetry
monitoring and tracing should not be an afterthought in the infrastructure
goals:
    metrics without instrumenting apps
    consistent metrics across fleet
    trace flow of requests across services
    portable across metric backend providers


proposed istio deployment controller

zipkin has really cool tracing
